# Algorithm for Finding a Qn Parking Function

## Abstract

Given a connected graph $G,$ we prove an algorithm to efficiently list all maximal $G$-parking functions. Since many combinatorial bijections between $G$-parking functions and spanning trees have been established in the literature, enumeration of spanning trees of $G$ and $G$-parking functions can be viewed as related problems. As an application, we implement our algorithm into Python and C to consider the enumeration of $G$-parking functions on the hypercube $Q_n$ in order to consider a simple combinatorial proof of the formula for the number of spanning trees of $Q_n,$ which Stanley refers to as not being known. Our algorithm allows us to consider an experimental approach to this problem. Refer to 'Draft.pdf' for a more comprehensive explaination of the algorithm.
